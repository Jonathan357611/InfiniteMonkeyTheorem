# Explanation

The "Infinite monkey theorem" is a theorem, which says that a monkey with a typewriter and an infinite amount of time WILL eventually write books, every finite number, etc

You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem).

# The program

This program will "simulate" the monkey in the descriped theorem by outputing random lower case letters very fast until it finds the searched word.
The program will also show you some statistics and chances.

### Demo

It is written using python and the curses library.

### Updates
